Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 5: Traffic Accident Data Analysis
Welcome to my submission for Task 5 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. In this task, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a traffic accident dataset to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is 
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents">
US Accidents (2016 - 2023)
</a>.

 

## Tools and Libraries used

- Kaggle notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization


The primary objective of this task was to analyze traffic accident data to uncover key factors contributing to road accidents. By examining variables such as weather conditions, road surface types, and the time of occurrence, the analysis aims to identify high-risk patterns and "hotspots" (temporal or environmental) to provide actionable insights for improving road safety and traffic management.



## Conclusion

Task 5 successfully identified critical trends in traffic accidents, demonstrating that incidents are heavily influenced by commuter behavior and environmental factors. The analysis revealed significant spikes during "rush hour" periods and highlighted that while a majority of accidents occur during clear weather, the severity and frequency are disproportionately affected by poor lighting and slippery road surfaces. Key findings suggest that the highest risk periods correlate with peak traffic flow, and specific road types are more prone to accidents under rainy conditions. These results offer actionable insights for local authorities, such as increasing police presence during identified peak hours and improving infrastructure lighting or signage in environmental hotspots to significantly reduce the rate of road traffic injuries.
Thank you for reviewing my submission!
